** The API Integration task in the Full Stack Web Development internship at CodeTech Interns involved developing a web application that integrates Weather and News APIs to display real-time information. The application retrieves weather data based on user input, such as city or location, using a weather API and presents details like temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions dynamically. Similarly, the news API fetches the latest headlines, categorizing them based on topics like technology, sports, business, and entertainment. The project required implementing GET requests using Fetch API or Axios, handling API responses, managing errors such as invalid locations or API rate limits, and ensuring smooth UI updates. The frontend was developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (React.js or vanilla JS), ensuring a responsive and user-friendly design. The integration also included features like search functionality, loading indicators, and proper error messages to improve user experience. This task strengthened skills in handling external APIs, managing asynchronous requests, and optimizing performance, making it a valuable learning experience in full-stack web development.**
